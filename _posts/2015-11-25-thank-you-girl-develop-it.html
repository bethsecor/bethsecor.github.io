<p> About a year ago I started taking classes through Girl Develop It (GDI). It’s an organization dedicated to teaching women web development, to balance out the gender gap in the tech industry. If it weren’t for GDI, I probably would not have discovered Turing. Many of the instructors were from Turing, and I learned so much from them.</p>
<p> This week we had to build a blog on Github using Jekyll. I was not concerned at all because of the previous training I had from GDI. I focused on making a clean design, and added several details that were not required. I added a favicon because I learned from building a web server a few weeks ago that a browser will always make a request for one. Also, I spent the better part of the afternoon today making my blog responsive, since that is arguably the most important feature a website should have these days.</p>
